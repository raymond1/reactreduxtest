I was given a coding challenge based off of
http://reactjsnews.com/your-first-redux-app.

My task was to provide CRM functionality, such as:
* Add a lead (name, phone number), --Done
* Log a call --Done
* Schedule an appointment,
* Convert lead to account

With bonus points for:
* Updating the phone number --Done
* Using a date-picker for the appointment.

In terms of visual styling, something similar to https://github.com/salesforce-ux/design-system is ideal

To run the app:
```
npm install
npm start
```

(If you use Debian, like me, then you might have to make a soft link to call nodejs node)

Load `http://localhost:8080`
